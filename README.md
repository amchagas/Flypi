Hi! Thanks for dropping by. This project started during one of the summer courses organized by [Trend in Africa](www.trendinafrica.org). It developed to the current state due to the efforts of many people along the way. In special Tom Baden, Lucia Prieto, and Edwin Cruz. A paper describing the system was published in [Plos Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002702).

 Version 1.0 was released with the paper and can be found [here](https://github.com/amchagas/Flypi/tree/v1.0.0).

The system can be used for optical microscopy, fluorescence, behavioural tracking, optogenetics, calcium imaging and thermogenetics (see examples recorded with the system below).


#### Some samples imaged with the device:
